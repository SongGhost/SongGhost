# SongHost Audio Orchestration & DJ Engine Specification

## 1. Finite State Machine (FSM) & Mutex Locking

To guarantee zero double-DJ executions, overlapping voice clips, or desynchronized track ducking, the audio orchestrator MUST operate as a strict Finite State Machine.

FSM States Defined
IDLE: Audio engine initialized, no tracks queued or playing.

PLAYING_MUSIC: Track audio playing at 100% volume gain (1.0).

PREFETCHING_BREAK: Fetching script from /api/generate-script and downloading/synthesizing TTS audio blob.

MODE A: DUCKING_OUTRO: Track A volume ducks from 100% (1.0) to target duck level (e.g. 18% or 0.18) over a 600ms linear ramp.

MODE A: SPEAKING_DJ_INBAND: DJ speech audio plays over ducked music. Track A finishes and Track B pre-rolls at ducked volume underneath speech.

MODE A: SWELLING_INTRO: Speech completes. Track B executes a logarithmic volume swell from ducked level to 100% (1.0) over 800ms.

MODE B: FADE_TO_STATION_BED: Track A fades out completely (0%) over 1500ms. Genre station bed loop fades in to 25% (0.25) volume.

MODE B: SPEAKING_DJ_STATION_BED: DJ delivers long-form commentary over station bed. Track B pre-rolls silently in background.

MODE B: HARD_LAUNCH_TRACK_B: Speech ends. Station bed pitch/volume decays over 400ms, and Track B launches at 100% (1.0) volume.

Single-Execution & Cleanup Rules
breakExecutedForCurrentTrack (boolean): Set to true instantly upon entering state #4 or #7. Blocks all subsequent break requests for the current track ID. Reset ONLY when trackId changes.

sessionEpoch (integer): Incremented on every station switch, host persona change, or manual setting edit. All async API promises check if (promiseEpoch !== currentSessionEpoch) and abort if mismatched.

currentAbortController: Active AbortController instance. Calling abort() cancels pending script fetches and TTS downloads, revokes object URLs, and flushes in-flight break state so the next track starts clean.

### 1.1 Audio Buffer Safety & Fallback Rules

**Zero-Byte Buffer Guard:** The orchestrator MUST verify `arrayBuffer.byteLength > 0` before initiating any volume fade or state transition into Mode A or Mode B. Empty TTS payloads MUST NOT proceed past `PREFETCHING_BREAK`.

**Failed Load Fallback:** If a TTS fetch returns an empty buffer or audio decoding / HTMLAudioElement load fails, abort Mode A / Mode B immediately and maintain **100% music playback gain**. Never execute volume fades (duck, fade-to-bed, or ramp-to-zero) on corrupted or 0-byte audio blobs. Restore or keep Spotify / companion music at full listening level and return to `PLAYING_MUSIC`.

## 4. TTS Synthesis Pipeline

Script generation (`/api/generate-script`) and shared prep (`src/lib/tts.ts`) produce the spoken payload. Downstream engines (ElevenLabs, OpenAI `tts-1`) receive only sanitized plain text.

### 4.1 TTS Input Sanitization

**SSML Stripping:** Strip or convert all XML / SSML tags (e.g. `<break time="..."/>`, `<say-as>`, and other markup) into natural punctuation (commas, periods, or ellipses) **before** dispatching text to third-party TTS engines that do not support raw XML payloads (including ElevenLabs REST and OpenAI `tts-1`). Raw SSML MUST never appear in the synthesis request body.
